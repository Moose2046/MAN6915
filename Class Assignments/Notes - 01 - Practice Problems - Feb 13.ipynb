    "Create a text file consisting of 20 rows of 30 integers. The integers should be in the range 0–9 and be separated by spaces. The file is a digital representation of a picture, with the values 0 through 9 representing increasing levels of darkness. Write a program that reads the contents of the file into a 20-by-30 array of ints. In a crude approach toward converting this digital representation to a picture, have the program use the values in this array to initialize a 20-by-31 array of chars, with a 0 value corresponding to a space character, a 1 value to the period character, and so on, with each larger number represented by a character that occupies more space. For example, you might use # to represent 9. The last character (the 31st) in each row should be a null character, making it an array of 20 strings. Have the program display the resulting picture (that is, print the strings) and also store the result in a text file. For example, suppose you start with this data:\n",

The property should validate the initial balance to ensure that it’s greater than or equal to 0.0; if not, throw an exception. The class should provide two public methods. Method `Credit` should add an amount to the current balance. Method `Debit` should withdraw money from the `Account` and ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the `Account`’s balance.
